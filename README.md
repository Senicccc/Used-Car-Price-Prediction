# 🚗 Used Cars Price Prediction — Data Mining Midterm Project

This project aims to **predict the price of used cars** using a dataset from Kaggle.  
The model applies **Linear Regression** with Python on Google Colab, focusing on practical steps of **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about used cars in India, including features such as:
- Car name and company  
- Year of manufacture  
- Fuel type  
- Transmission type  
- Mileage, engine size, and more  

**Source:**  
[Used Cars Price Prediction Dataset (GitHub)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FarrelllAdityaaa/dataset-uts-datamining/refs/heads/main/used_cars_price_fiks.csv)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load dataset using **pandas**
- Handle missing values by removing or filling with appropriate statistics
- Convert categorical variables into numeric format using **One-Hot Encoding**
- Drop unnecessary columns such as IDs or redundant data

### 2. Data Splitting & Scaling
- Split dataset into **80% training data** and **20% testing data**
- Normalize features using **StandardScaler** to improve regression performance

### 3. Model Development
- Train a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Fit the model with training data and make predictions on testing data

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using several metrics:
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** — measures how well the model fits the data  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** — average magnitude of prediction error  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** — penalizes large errors  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** — interpretable in the same unit as target price  

### 5. Visualization
- Scatter plot between **actual vs predicted prices**  
- Residual analysis to check if the model errors are normally distributed

## 💡 Summary

This project demonstrates how to:
- Apply **data preprocessing** and handle real-world datasets  
- Build a **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn  
- Evaluate and visualize model performance effectively  

Through this project, we can better understand how simple regression models can be used  
to make data-driven predictions for real business scenarios such as car pricing.
